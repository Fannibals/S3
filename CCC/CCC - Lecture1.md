##### Cloud Characteristics

- **<font color = purple>Five essential characteristics</font>** 
  - <font color=blue>On-demand self-service</font>
    - A consumer can provision computing capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
  - <font color=blue>Networked access</font>
    - Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous client platforms.
  - <font color=blue>Resource pooling</font>
    - The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model potentially with different physical and virtual resources that can be dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.
  - <font color=blue>Rapid elasticity</font>
    - Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly upon demand.
  - <font color=blue>Measured service</font>
    - Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service.
